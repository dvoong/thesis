%\section{Conclusion}

%In this thesis I have outlined the key physics that underlies particle production phenomena as well as highlighted some future areas of interest for this area of physics. I hope I have shown that the LHCb detector is highly suited to this field of research due especially to its exceptional tracking and as well as its overall performance in all areas. I have presented a method in which the HPDs in the Cherenkov imaging detectors have been aligned due to an effective shift in its position. It is important to note that this phenomenon was not expect
