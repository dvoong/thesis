\subsection{Quantum Field Theory (QFT)}

Quantum field theory is built on concepts from Quantum Mechanics, Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory. Fundamental particles are described as excitations or quanta of the fields. For example, electrons are quanta of the electron field and similarly photons are quanta of the electromagnetic field i.e. interactions between electrons can be described as being a result of the interaction between the electron field and electromagnetic field. Mathematically these interactions can be described using the Lagrangian Formalism. 

\subsubsection{Lagrangian Formalism}
With Lagrangian mechanics the equations of motion for a given field is derived by minimising the action $\mathcal{S}$ given by,

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{S} = \int\mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi) \mathrm{d}^4x
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian density, $\phi$ is the field and $\partial_\mu$ is the differential operator acting on the space and time coordinates of the field as seen in special relativity. By applying the condition of the Principle of Least Action, the equations of motion are given by the Euler-Lagrange equation,

\begin{equation}
	\partial_\mu(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu\phi_i)}) = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi_i}
\end{equation}
