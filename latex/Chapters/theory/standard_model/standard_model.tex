\section{The Standard Model}

%The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory that describes fundamental particles and their interactions.
%In the standard model physical phenomena are made up of the fundamental particles or compositions of fundamental particles.
%The fundamental particles are classified into quarks, leptons, gauge bosons and the Higg's boson.
%Fundamental particles are classified into fermions and bosons based on their intrinsic property of spin.
%Fermions are further subdivided into leptons and quarks.
%Both leptons are quarks have three generations.
%Bosons are subdivided into gauge bosons and the Higg's boson.
%Gauge bosons mediate interactions between particles.

The Standard Model %of particle physics is a theory that% 
describes fundamental particles and their interactions mediated via force carrying particles. It describes electromagnetism, the weak force and the strong force. 

%Gravity is not incorporated into the standard model though in many cases the gravitational interaction between particles is very small with respect to the other three fundamental forces. For example at the atomic scale the  in these situations the Standard Model has consistently made accurate predictions.

The Standard Model is built upon the principles of Quantum Field Theory and renormalizable gauge theories developed in the twentieth century \cite{Griffiths:Introduction-to-elementary-particles}. It is most commonly represented in the form of the Lagrangian formalism and is divided into the following sectors. The Electroweak sector - describing both electromagnetic forces and weak interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) sector - describing the strong interaction and the Higg's sector - describing interactions with the Higg's field.

The Standard Model has proven to be an extremely successful theory having exceptional predictive powers - the theoretical prediction of the electron anomalous magnetic moment being in agreement with experimental data to 10 significant figures \cite{PhysRevLett.97.030801}. 


%Interactions between particles are interpreted as being a result of the exchange of force mediating particles - the gauge bosons mentioned in the previous section. The Standard Model describes interactions between particles as being either via electromagnetic, strong or weak forces. These forces are described by the following theories: the Electroweak theory and Quantum Chromodynamics. In general electromagnetic and weak interactions are described together by the Electroweak theory which is a unification of their respective theories. These theories are built on the framework of quantum field theory. Gravity is not included in the Standard model due to its non-renormalisability as a quantum field theory.

%Quantum Electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic force as being the result of the exchange of photons between charged particles, this is an extremely successful theory which exhibits some of the most accurate predictions of any theory. The strong force is most well known for its role in holding nucleons together in the nucleus of the atom, this described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics; the strong force is mediated via gluons. The weak interaction is most well known for its role in the process of beta decay; it is mediated by the W and Z gauge bosons. The electromagnetic and weak interactions care together be described the Electroweak theory, this theory incorporates parts of QED and weak interaction physics together with the concept of Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking. This theory describes electromagnetic and weak interactions as originating from the same force, the process of the electro-weak symmetry breaking causes this force to manifest itself as these two components. Finally the Higg's particle interacts with certain particles, giving rise to the property of massive particles via the Higg's mechanism.
