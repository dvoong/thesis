\subsection{Gauge Theories}
\label{section: gauge theories}

A gauge theory is defined by a Lagrangian which is invariant under continuous local transformations of the fields or coordinates. 

\begin{equation}
	\delta \mathcal{L} = 0
\end{equation}

Each possible gauge transformations can be represented by a matrix; together these matrices form a group under matrix multiplication - the symmetry group of the gauge theory.

For each generator of the group there is an associated gauge field, for example, in QED there is one generator to the U(1) group which is associated to the electromagnetic four-vector potential field. Similarly, in QCD there are 8 generators associated to the SU(3) group corresponding to 8 gluon fields. The quanta of the gauge fields are called gauge bosons, for the previous examples these are the photon and gluons respectively.

The symmetry group for the Standard Model is U1 x SU(2) x SU(3), it is a non-Abelian group with 12 gauge fields; the corresponding gauge bosons are the photon, W+, W-, Z0 and eight types of gluon.
