\subsection{Electromagnetism}

The standard model describes the electromagnetic force as being the result of the exchange of photons between charged particles. This interaction is described by the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an extremely successful theory which exhibits some of the most accurate predictions of any theory.
