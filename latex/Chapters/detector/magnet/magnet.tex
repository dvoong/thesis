\label{section: magnet}

A dipole magnet is present for momentum determination of charged particles. The magnet provides an integrated downstream field of $3.6$ Tm which results in a momentum resolution better than $\delta p / p \approx 0.5\%$ for tracks with momentum less than 200 GeV \cite{Amato:424338}. The magnet is positioned after the VELO and RICH 1 sub detectors so that the magnetic field does not effect the vertex reconstruction and particle identification of low momentum particles. The structure of the magnet is designed such that the magnetic field does not disrupt the components of other sub-detectors such as the Photon detectors in the RICH systems which use large electric fields. The field lines of the dipole magnet result in a predominantly horizontal Lorentz force on the charged particles in the LHCb detector, consequently tracks are predominantly bent in this plane.
