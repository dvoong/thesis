  abstract={The LHCb experiment is a spectrometer dedicated to the study of heavy flavor at the LHC. The trigger system plays a key role in selecting signal events and rejecting background at the data acquisition phase. The bulk of the LHCb trigger is implemented in software and deployed on a farm running about 20000 processes to analyse incoming events parallel. This system, called the High Level Trigger (HLT), is responsible for reducing the rate from the maximum at which the detector can be read out, 1 MHz, to the 3 kHz which can be processed off-line. Because of the specific LHC running conditions, the HLT had to cope with three times higher event multiplicities than it was designed for in 2010 and 2011. This contribution describes the software architecture of the HLT, focusing on the code optimization and commissioning effort which took place during 2010 and 2011 in order to enable LHCb to trigger efficiently in these unexpected running conditions, and the flexibility and robustness of the LHCb software framework which allowed this reoptimization to be performed in a timely manner.}

  abstract={The performance of the LHCb Muon system and its stability across the full 2010 data taking with LHC running at œôøº s = 7 TeV energy is studied. The optimization of the detector setting and the time calibration performed with the first collisions delivered by LHC is described. Particle rates, measured for the wide range of luminosities and beam operation conditions experienced during the run, are compared with the values expected from simulation. The space and time alignment of the detectors, chamber efficiency, time resolution and cluster size are evaluated. The detector performance is found to be as expected from specifications or better. Notably the overall efficiency is well above the design requirements.}
